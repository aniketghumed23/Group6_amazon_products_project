## Data Source

### Amazon Dataset

- **Availability:** Publicly available.
- **Nature:** Comprehensive dataset comprising 1.4 million products, encompassing information on product categories, pricing, customer reviews, and historical sales data.
- **Quality:** The dataset necessitates merging, cleansing, and preparation for machine learning to ensure its relevance to the project scope.
- **Source Link:** [Amazon Products Dataset 2023 (1.4M Products) on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/amazon-products-dataset-2023-1-4m-products)


### Domain-specific Challenges

- **Privacy and Ethics:** Protecting customer privacy is paramount in e-commerce. Any predictive model must comply with data protection regulations and ethical considerations.

- **Bias in Reviews:** Addressing potential biases in customer reviews that might influence the predictive model. Ensuring fairness in recommendations and predictions.

### KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

**Metrics of Success:**
- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision:** Proportion of correctly predicted best-selling products among those predicted.
- **Recall:** Proportion of actual best-selling products correctly predicted.
- **F1-Score:** A balance between precision and recall, considering both false positives and false negatives.

Setting clear KPIs will guide the optimization process and ensure the effectiveness of the predictive model in the e-commerce domain.
